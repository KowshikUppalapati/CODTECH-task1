### **Overview of the Code**

**PROJECT NAME**:SIMPLE CALCULATIOR

The code implements a **Basic Calculator Program** in Python that allows users to perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


### **Objective**

To create an interactive program that takes user input and performs arithmetic calculations based on the user's choice.


### **Key Points**

1. **Functions for Arithmetic Operations**:
   - The code defines separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:
     - `add(x, y)`: Adds two numbers.
     - `subtract(x, y)`: Subtracts the second number from the first.
     - `multiply(x, y)`: Multiplies two numbers.
     - `divide(x, y)`: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.

2. **Interactive User Input**:
   - The user is presented with a menu to choose an operation.
   - The program validates the user's input and ensures a valid choice is made.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - For division, the code checks if the divisor is zero and prevents invalid operations.

4. **Dynamic Output**:
   - Based on the user's selection, the program performs the chosen operation and displays the result in a clear format.

5. **Loop for Valid Input**:
   - The program ensures that users provide valid input (`1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`) before proceeding.


### **Technologies Used**

1. **Python Programming**:
   - The program is implemented using Python, known for its simplicity and readability.
2. **Control Structures**:
   - **While Loop**: Ensures the user provides a valid choice.
   - **Conditional Statements (`if-elif`)**: Directs the flow based on user selection.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Explicitly checks for division by zero to prevent runtime errors.
